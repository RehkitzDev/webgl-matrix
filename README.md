[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/ackermlion/webgl-matrix/_apis/build/status/liona24.webgl-matrix?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/ackermlion/webgl-matrix/_build/latest?definitionId=1&branchName=master)

## Getting Started

This is a lightweight matrix / vector library meant for usage with WebGL.

At the core this library only consists of a trait `Matrix`. All implementations are optional features and can be added as needed.

Available features:
* `Matrix4`: 4x4 matrix operations (includes *Vector4*)
* `Matrix3`: 3x3 matrix operations (includes *Vector3*)
* `Vector4`: 4-dimensional vector operations
* `Vector3`: 3-dimensional vector operations
